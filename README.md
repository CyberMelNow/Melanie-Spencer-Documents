This is a collection of Ansible and Linux scripts created during my cybersecurity training at Georgia Tech.

These scripts were used to configure and run various docker containers.

The setup was four virtual machines including a jumpbox, 2 DVWA and an ELK stack.  The purpose of the setup was to send logs and other data to kibana for easier analysis.
